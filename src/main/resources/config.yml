#YAML Editor Suggestions
#Windows? This file might not display well in Notepad. I suggest Notepad++.
#Linux? You probably know what you're doing. If not, I think gedit can display YAML
#properly? If not, I just run Notepad++ in Wine.

#Broken config? Save this file to your desktop, delete the config.yml found in your
#server, and reload or restart your server. A new one will generate, and you can
#retype your old settings back into the freshly generated file. Don't just copy and
#paste everything, because that just re-adds your broken stuff.

#Do not modify this. this is used by HorseStats internally, and if altered, may cause
#false warning messages.

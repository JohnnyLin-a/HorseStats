#YAML Editor Suggestions
#Windows? This file might not display well in Notepad. I suggest Notepad++.
#Linux? You probably know what you're doing. If not, I think gedit can display YAML
#properly? If not, I just run Notepad++ in Wine.

#Simply translate the text here into whatever language you want. Whatever you
#put here is what will appear in game. Do not modify the YAML headers, as this
#will break things.

#If this file breaks for some reason, backup your translations, and delete this
#file. A new one with the original English will generate the next time you start
#or reload your server.

#Each line starts with a quotation mark, and ends with a quotation mark. Removing
#either of these will cause read/write errors and break the file. There are not
#quotes in the middle of any of these strings.

#If you wish to submit your translation file and have it be officially supported
#by HorseStats, send me a PM on BukkitDev and I'll check it out.

#The text in this file is sorted by the classes the strings belong in. This is
#mainly to help me with development, but should make your life easier too.

#HorseStats uses the raw "true" and "false" objects returned by horse statistics,
#and thus these cannot be translated.

#Do not modify the translate version. If you do, this file might be deleted, errors
#may pop up, false warnings may pop up in console, or text in game may be replaced with
#the word "null".
